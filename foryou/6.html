                </p>
               <p>
                6 months. gakerasa ya udah 6 bulan ^^ 6 months of blessings, 6 months of happiness, 6 months of us being together. My feeling haven’t changed since i first saw you, you’re still a 100/10 in my eyes, still giving me butterflies like you always do, and my love to you grew stronger every single second im with you. I still remembered our first kiss, to have an angel kisses you liked that made me realised that god has given me a blessing that no one has, its having you, Dominique Ashanty Walia as a special person, im grateful to wake up everyday and knows that you love me like you always do, if god has given me a choice between going to heaven and not meeting you at all i wouldnt even let him finish and would choose the second option, which is being with you… Nothing will beat the feeling of having my heart filled with butterflies because you said “gantengkuu”, its a blessing, it really is.
               </p>
               <p>
                Even though we fought and argued, my heart will still say that loving you and having you is better than to win and hugging you tight is better than to lose you, because having you by my side is already enough for me, i’ve never felt this feeling before, not with anyone and im grateful to have experienced it with you, its feeling “loved” i felt euphoric everytime i saw you, everytime you hugged me, everytime you kissed me, no one will ever give that same feeling as you do.

               </p>

               <p>
                The point is,, thank you for everything, the past 6 months was really an experience for me, the best if i must say,, happy 6 months anniversary princess, i love you my little angel

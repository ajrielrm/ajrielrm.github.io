                    [Dear Monique]
                </p>
                <p>
                    November is the gloomiest month of the year, 2 months till new years eve but i felt lonely knowing that i have nobody. 7th of November is when i met you the weeks that followed was the happiest one in my life, i could remember the first time you asked me if its okay if you bought me Indomie, we met at the canteen again, we talked, we joked, and we sat next to each other,  i remembered you blushed when my friends and ur friends were teasing us from the upper floor, it was the happiest day of my life knowing that someone actually cared about me. We talked for hours and hours on whatsapp, i still remember those cringy jokes that i made. Until finally i asked you out on a date, i was actually surprised you would say yes, i jumped out of my bed happy that we were going out next sunday. I picked you up on sunday and goes to bxc, i panicked knowing that i didn't prepare anything for that date, "maybe ill just buy her a bracelet" i said to myself and i did got you a bracelet, when i put it on your hands i blanked, maybe it was your eyes, maybe it was your cute face, but i blanked.  I asked you if you wanna watched a movie, you said yes, and we picked seat 12 and 13, as we sat down i panicked again not knowing what the fuck to do. As the movies plays in the background i suddenly felt this thing, idk what it was but i just knew that it was the right time, i held your hand.... I PANICKED the feeling of your heart wanting to jump out of your body was unreal, i got lost, lost in your soft hand, blanked as i was drunk on 300 bottles of rum. 30 minutes passed by and the movie ended, i looked in your eyes and you looked into mine, i confessed my feelings to you and the rest is history [13/11/22].

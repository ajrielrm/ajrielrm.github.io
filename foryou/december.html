                    [Dear The Love Of My Life]
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was the 7th of November when you came to my life, coincidentally the same day as my birthday. It has been idk 4 years since someone has given me a gift even my parents, i thought this year was gonna be the same, same as before, same as 4 years ago, everyone greets me with a "Happy Birthday" but i just knew that it'll be somewhat temporary and will not last, as i was going to the canteen and walk past through everyone i suddenly saw this girl, she was beautiful, different than the other, it'd suddenly clicked that I've seen this girl before but i don't know where, i brushed my shoulder off thinking that she wouldn't even notice me. But suddenly Laura tapped my shoulder, she was with this girl, i thought to myself "Who is she" over and over again i got lost in those beautiful brown eyes until you said "Happy birthday",  i came back confused like i was drunk from drinking 3 bottles of whiskey because of those eyes, i replied "thx ka" and go on with my days but i couldn't stop thinking "Who is she", suddenly my phone notification rang and it said that someone has followed me, i said "Who is this". I suddenly realized that it was the girl from the canteen, i followed her back and we talked for hours and hours, this girl was different from the other ones i talked to, because this girl is you, you're my birthday gift that the world has given me, and i'm blessed to have you in my life, thank you... Monique.                </p>

                    <p>Happy 1 Month Anniversary, To my lovely girlfriend -Ajriel</p>

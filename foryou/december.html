                    [Dear The Love Of My Life]
                </p>
                <p>
                   		Hi Monn!! the love of my life, about a month ago we started dating and honestly it has been the greatest month in my entire life. Through this letter i just wanna say that, thank you for being here, thank you for being the best part of my life, youre always there for me no matter what, youre my number 1 support system. I couldnt express how thankful i am for having you in my life, 100 mornings and 100 nights couldn't even express the love i have for you. Even if there are millions upon millions of multiverses that dictates my life, i'd still choose the one where im with you, if i was not born in this universe i'd talk to dr strange and ask him to open up a portal just to live a life where im with you. If i were a kid then you'd be the favorite ice cream stand that ill always come back for, because you made me addicted to you, idk if its your personality or your cute face but i'm like an addict high on adderral everytime you're by my side.
		If youre reading this that means its our 1 month anniversary and i hope we'll be together for many months and years to come, thank you monique for always being on my side no matter what, sorry if i've made many mistakes along the way, sorry if im not perfect, thank you... For everything. <3 </p>

                    <p>Happy 1 Month Anniversary, To my lovely girlfriend -Ajriel</p>
